# Shipyard — Governed Delivery & Shared Harness

Shipyard is the delivery methodology behind seven opt-in skills: `drydock`, `ask-navigator`, `loft`, `harbor`, `launch`, `architecture-survey`, and `minimal-code-discipline`. Its premise in one line:

> **Everyone ships, and nobody ships randomly** — agents continuously run everything repeatable and acceptable-by-evidence; humans decide what cannot be judged by the system or what fails expensively.

This page is the map of the methodology: the boundary principle, the roles, the four pillars, the surface layout, the working metaphor, and how the seven skills compose. The skills themselves (`/oh-my-claudecode:drydock`, `/oh-my-claudecode:ask-navigator`, `/oh-my-claudecode:loft`, `/oh-my-claudecode:harbor`, `/oh-my-claudecode:launch`, `/oh-my-claudecode:architecture-survey`, `/oh-my-claudecode:minimal-code-discipline`) are the executable form.

## The verifiability boundary

Every step in a launch run answers one test question: *if this is done wrong, can the system detect it? Can it redo or roll back automatically?*

- **Both yes → agents run it continuously** (the repeatable ~80%): fact-finding, spec/ticket drafting, lofting design questions, tdd implementation, builds, tests, code-review, verify, scheduling.
- **Either no → the human decides it** (the critical ~20%): acceptance criteria, seam selection, ticket granularity, irreversible architecture decisions, final acceptance.

It is not "let agents do as much as possible" — it is "delegate exactly what can be accepted, nothing more."

## The roles

Roles divide by decision authority, not by species:

| Role | Who | Signature moments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The captain | the human | W1 destination, W2 chart, C1–C5 — seven signatures per effort; everything else is delegated |
| The navigator | the agent drafts, the captain confirms | `ask-navigator` on an ocean passage; launch's Phase 1 frontier interview is the same navigator on inland waters |
| The harbormaster | the agent inspects, the captain rules | `harbor` at the intake: verify every claim, present the docket; the captain signs accept / reject / merge |
| The crew | every builder, human or agent | starting needs no permission; landing goes into a shipyard slot |
| The classification society | the standards, surveyed | `docs/standards/` + `design-system/`, checked by the yard gate, code-review, and verify |

The captain is always human because fog-of-war decisions cannot be verified in advance — there is no spec yet to detect against. Agents hold every other role because drafting, building, and inspecting are evidence-checkable.

The premise sentence is the role model compressed: **everyone ships** is the admission rule (humans and agents are both crew); **nobody ships randomly** is the discipline (every landing passes a slot and a class check). Fog is the third case: without a navigator, a foggy effort either stops shipping or ships randomly — the navigator is how it obeys both halves: chart first, build later.

## The four pillars → five surfaces

A repo that humans and agents both build on carries four pillars across five conceptual surfaces. `/oh-my-claudecode:drydock` lays them; every later session inherits them by reading.

| Conceptual surface | Concrete paths | Carries / filled by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared context | `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/business/` + `docs/adr/` + OMC wiki | Glossary, business knowledge, and decision records; launch writes the file-backed paper trail and wiki compounds session knowledge |
| Rules | `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/standards/` | Thin conventions/principles/index plus architecture, data, and process standards; drydock seeds them and the launch C5 sediment pass/reviews sediment recurring corrections |
| Project skills | `.omc/skills/` | Reusable project capabilities and practices; contributors add them through the skillify quality gate |
| Design system | `design-system/` | Tokens, components, and patterns; drydock seeds it for UI repos and may create a stub or skip it for non-UI repos |
| MCP / CLI tools | `.mcp.json` + `scripts/` | MCP servers and repository automation; drydock seeds empty tool surfaces and integrations are added only when needed |

## The metaphor family (for teaching the system)

| Metaphor | Maps to | In one line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The shipyard | The whole harness | A shared facility; everyone comes here to build |
| The keel | Shared context + rules surfaces | Lay the skeleton first; the hull grows upward |
| The fog | An effort whose destination isn't stateable yet | Nobody ships randomly — and nobody ships into fog without a chart |
| The navigator | `/oh-my-claudecode:ask-navigator` | Charts the fog as a map of decision tickets; hands off, never builds |
| The loft | `/oh-my-claudecode:loft` | Cut no steel until the shape is fair: a throwaway artifact answers a design question before real work begins |
| The harbor | `/oh-my-claudecode:harbor` | The port's gate: external requests inspected, dispositioned, and turned into work orders — never merges, never decides |
| The classification society | `docs/standards/` + `design-system/` | A ship must pass class to sail = changes must pass standards to merge |
| The charts | specs + tickets | Launch's output; build from the chart |
| The logbook | `docs/adr/` | Decisions, auditable after the fact |
| The launch | `/oh-my-claudecode:launch` | Everyone may launch — and not one class check may be skipped |
| The lookout | `omc lookout` | The mast watch: before an unattended run, scan the briefing and the workspace for danger — the lookout reports, the captain decides |

## The seven skills compose

- **`drydock`** lays the keel once per repo (surfaces + seeds + `--check` drift audit). The `--check` report states per-finding confidence and whether the finding is actionable after excluding a user-declared scratch/throwaway scope; its mechanical subset is executable (`node scripts/shipyard-audit.mjs [repoRoot]`) and emits findings in the same severity/confidence/actionable vocabulary the lookout CLI uses — the structured contract both surfaces share.
- **`ask-navigator`** charts foggy efforts (destination unclear → a map of decision tickets on the tracker, worked one ticket per session) and hands the collapsed decisions to launch as a mission brief. Resolutions sediment into the same paper-trail slots launch's Phase 1 uses. It produces decisions, never deliverables.
- **`loft`** answers a design question that prose cannot settle with a throwaway artifact — a pure logic module in a clickable shell, or structurally different UI variants behind one route. The captain reacts; the answer lands in the decision; the artifact never docks. Called by launch's Phase 1 detour and the navigator's `loft` tickets.
- **`harbor`** is the intake gate for external work: sweeps incoming issues and PRs, verifies every claim (reproduce, check out, run), routes fog to the navigator, and hands the maintainer a short docket whose only remaining work is signing. Facts are harbor's to gather autonomously; dispositions and merges are the captain's to sign. The recurring-request clusters in its sweep summary are the feedback loop's outer ear — demand signals from the world, sedimenting into `docs/business/` or promoting into ideas.
- **`launch`** runs delivery per feature (fog gate → yard gate → C1 brief → C2 spec+seams → C3 tickets → frontier execution with C4 decision stops → C5 closeout with a `--check` re-audit), with the human at exactly the checkpoints that fail expensively. The fog gate routes an effort whose destination cannot be stated to the navigator before the run starts. The yard gate blocks on high-confidence actionable drydock findings (listing them verbatim and producing no artifacts) and admits only a clean audit or a narrowly, explicitly overridden low-confidence / false-positive / scratch-scope finding — no general bypass.
- **`minimal-code-discipline`** is an opt-in discipline for code written inside tickets (YAGNI ladder, smallest correct diff).
- **`architecture-survey`** periodically walks the module graph and reports ranked deepening candidates — shallow modules, hypothetical seams, logic behind the wrong seam — each with file:line evidence, a deepening move, and a risk note. Survey, not rescue: the report is the captain's decision input (mission-brief or grilling material), never auto-work. It never edits code, is not a gate, and is not merged into the drydock drift audit.

The gates form one chain with the same anatomy — run checks, list findings verbatim, sign only what fails expensively: **harbor gate** (take this external request?) → **fog gate** (can the destination be stated?) → **yard gate** (are the surfaces laid and clean?) → C1–C5 (quality signatures).

They share one rule of thumb: **starting needs no permission; landing goes into a shipyard slot.** A change that cannot say which slot it lands in (or explicitly none) is the smell.

Two levers every checkpoint pulls: **push right** — a checkpoint is deferred as late as it can be, so the captain is asked once, late, with everything prepared (launch's batched C4 decisions are this lever in operation); and **the brief** — what a checkpoint presents is a decision-ready summary (what was produced, why, where the evidence lives), never the raw draft.

`omc lookout` (a CLI command, not a skill) is the mast watch that can feed these gates: before an unattended effort starts it scans the task briefing and the workspace for high-confidence danger signals and reports them in the same findings vocabulary (severity / confidence / actionable) the `--check` audit's executable script emits — one structured contract, two consumers. Advisory only, by design: it never blocks, and it pairs with the remote approval gates and checkpoints when a signal is real.

## The invocation contract

Every shipyard skill — the seven compose skills plus the `agent-doc-discipline` companion — sits on one of two axes:

- **User-invoked** — reachable only by the human typing the skill (`/oh-my-claudecode:launch`). Other skills may point the human at them, but never invoke them through the Skill tool. `launch`, `harbor`, `ask-navigator`, and `architecture-survey` are user-invoked entry points, marked `disable-model-invocation: true` in frontmatter where the harness honors it.
- **Model-invoked** — reachable by the model when the task fits, and callable by other skills ("call the Skill tool with ..."). `drydock`, `loft`, `minimal-code-discipline`, and `agent-doc-discipline` stay model-invoked.

The iron rule: a user-invoked skill never invokes another user-invoked skill. The one deliberate exception is `drydock` — it is a human keel-laying entry point *and* the gate chain's callable audit: launch's yard gate and the navigator's charting mechanically call `drydock --check`, so it must remain model-invoked. The shipyard contract test suite pins the assignment in both directions and rejects skill text that invokes a user-invoked skill by name through the Skill tool.

## The loop — the methodology's spine

The gates are not a chain that ends at delivery; they form one **closed circuit**. Every stage hands its output to a named gate, and the circuit closes: sediment that becomes a recurring demand signal re-enters as business knowledge, not as a new intake class.

The joins, each named as a gate:

- **harbor gate** — take this external request? Intake classifies before verifying; unanswerable decisions exit as decision questionnaires; every disposition passes the restatement gate before it ships.
- **fog gate** — can the destination be stated? No → the navigator charts a map; large efforts get a long-lived map with vessels and a census line, worked one ticket per session until the way is clear.
- **yard gate** — are the surfaces laid and clean? High-confidence actionable drydock findings block; narrow, explicit overrides only.
- **C1–C5** — the captain's quality signatures; C3 tickets declare load-bearing blocking edges, C5 closeout consumes a structured retro and sediments lessons into their slots.
- **wayfinding join** — the navigator's collapsed decisions re-enter as a mission brief; its resolutions sediment into the same paper-trail slots launch's Phase 1 uses.
- **closure join** — the loop's exit and entrance are the same door: harbor's sweep summary surfaces recurring request clusters (the loop's outer ear), and sediment that keeps being demanded re-enters as `docs/business/` knowledge or fresh ideas.

The cross-cutting express surfaces — **diagram** and **show-me** — are callable from any stage of the circuit; they are express lanes, not stages.

Shipyard corrects itself through its file-backed paper trail; `/oh-my-claudecode:drydock --check` audits harness drift. These skills do not add a separate findings store, shipped/wontfixed state machine, hidden ledger, or `sy check`/`context-lint` commands.

## When to reach for what

- one-point fix → `execute` directly (no shipyard ceremony)
- multi-step feature → `launch`
- foggy effort (destination unclear, questions not yet stateable) → `ask-navigator` first; it hands back a mission brief
- external requests piling up (issues, bug reports, PRs) → `harbor` sweeps the intake and hands over a signature queue
- new repo, or a repo where knowledge lives in heads → `drydock` first
- writing-time code discipline inside any of the above → `minimal-code-discipline`
- repo getting harder to change, or a periodic maintenance survey → `architecture-survey` reports ranked deepening candidates (no code edits)

Shipyard adds no daemon, no mode, no always-on behavior: the surfaces are ordinary repository files, the skills are plain instructions, and the canonical `plan → execute → review → verify` spine remains the default path. Shipyard is opt-in at every door.
